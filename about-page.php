    <h4 class="mb-4 font-bold ">Canada’s labour market is undergoing rapid and complex change—shaped by economic uncertainty, supply chain disruption, technological acceleration, and shifting talent demands. In this climate, businesses and policymakers need trusted insights to act with confidence.</h4>
    <p>Workforce Pulse was launched to meet that need. This national initiative brings together fourteen industry organizations representing over two-thirds of Canada’s private-sector workforce to capture real-time input from employers on workforce challenges, hiring expectations, recruitment barriers, and skills needs. Supported by the Future Skills Centre (FSC), Workforce Pulse gathers and analyzes timely feedback from businesses across multiple sectors. The insights produced are designed to inform decisions, shape responsive policy, and guide investment in workforce solutions that reflect real-world needs.
